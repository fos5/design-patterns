# State Design Pattern Documentation

The State Design Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It encapsulates state-specific behavior into separate classes, promoting the Open/Closed Principle.

## Key Components
1. **State Interface**: Defines the common behavior for all concrete states.
2. **Concrete States**: Implement the behavior associated with a particular state of the context.
3. **Context**: Maintains a reference to the current state and delegates state-specific behavior to the current state.

## Example Implementation
- **State**: The interface defining the methods for state-specific behavior.
- **PlayState**, **PauseState**, **StoppedState**: Concrete implementations of the `State` interface.
- **MediaPlayer**: The context class that changes its behavior based on the current state.

## Advantages
- Simplifies the code by organizing state-specific behavior into separate classes.
- Makes it easier to add new states without modifying existing code.

## Disadvantages
- Increases the number of classes in the system.
- Can introduce complexity if there are many states.

## Usage
Ideal for scenarios where an objectâ€™s behavior depends on its state , and it must change behavior at runtime.
